# Chatbot-Music-Recommender-System
A cutting-edge chatbot that effortlessly recommends music to users based solely on their chat interactions and tone. The incorporation of a self-learning mechanism not only enhances its adaptability but also allows for easy customization, empowering users to tailor the chatbot according to their preferences and needs.

Elaborated version:
This project aims to provide a more personalized and emotionally relevant music recommendation experience by incorporating user tone analysis into the chatbot-based music recommendation system. The user interacts with the chatbot, and the system analyzes the user's tone to determine their emotional state. Based on the user's tone, the chatbot recommends a suitable song that can enhance their mood or provide comfort. Additionally, the project includes a self-learning chatbot feature that allows the system to continually improve its recommendations based on user interactions. The chatbot learns from previous conversations and user feedback, providing more accurate and relevant recommendations over time. The system gives the user the choice to either listen to the recommended song or end the conversation. This feature provides greater control and autonomy to the user, ensuring a positive and non-intrusive user experience. Besides these, our system comprises of four modules. Initially they have to interact with the chatbot, after chatting with the chat bot, current mood of the user is analyzed and list of songs is suggested to user, using the concept of NLP (Natural Language Processing). Based on the list of songs user can choose the song to be played based on his or her choice. We have used Python as our prime language because it supports an extensive set of open-source libraries which can be used by our system. This includes not only the song lyrics, but also the metadata such as artist, album, and genre. To handle this data, we use powerful NLP tools such as NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim, which allow us to preprocess and analyze the data efficiently.
